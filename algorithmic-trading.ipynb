JP Morgan Chase & Co. is one of the businesses that use Algorithmic Trading for investment decisions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What is Algorithmic Trading?\n\n- Algorithmic Trading means using algorithms in buying and selling decisions in the financial market. In an algorithmic trading strategy, a set of predefined rules are used to determine when to buy a financial instrument and when to sell it.\n\n- In simple words, Algorithmic Trading is a way of buying and selling automatically and efficiently, which is always better than trading manually.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How Algorithmic Trading Works\n\n- Suppose a trader follows these simple trade criteria:\n\n    - Buy 50 shares of a stock when its 50-day moving average goes above the 200-day moving average. (A moving average is an average of past data points that smooths out day-to-day price fluctuations and thereby identifies trends.)  \n\n    - Sell shares of the stock when its 50-day moving average goes below the 200-day moving average.\n\n- Using these two simple instructions, a computer program will automatically monitor the stock price (and the moving average indicators) and place the buy and sell orders when the defined conditions are met. The trader no longer needs to monitor live prices and graphs or put in the orders manually. The algorithmic trading system does this automatically by correctly identifying the trading opportunity. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Advantages and Disadvantages\n\n## Advantages\n\n- Algo-trading provides the following advantages:\n\n    - Best Execution: Trades are often executed at the best possible prices.\n\n    - Low Latency: Trade order placement is instant and accurate (there is a high chance of execution at the desired levels). Trades are timed correctly and instantly to avoid significant price changes.\n\n    - Reduced transaction costs.\n\n    - Simultaneous automated checks on multiple market conditions.\n\n    - No Human Error: Reduced risk of manual errors or mistakes when placing trades. Also negates human traders; tendency to be swayed by emotional and psychological factors.\n\n    - Backtesting: Algo-trading can be backtested using available historical and real-time data to see if it is a viable trading strategy.\n\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n- There are also several drawbacks or disadvantages of algorithmic trading to consider:\n\n    - Latency: Algorithmic trading relies on fast execution speeds and low latency, which is the delay in the execution of a trade. If a trade is not executed quickly enough, it may result in missed opportunities or losses.\n\n    - Black Swan Events: Algorithmic trading relies on historical data and mathematical models to predict future market movements. However, unforeseen market disruptions, known as black swan events, can occur, which can result in losses for algorithmic traders.\n\n    - Dependence on Technology: Algorithmic trading relies on technology, including computer programs and high-speed internet connections. If there are technical issues or failures, it can disrupt the trading process and result in losses.\n\n    - Market Impact: Large algorithmic trades can have a significant impact on market prices, which can result in losses for traders who are not able to adjust their trades in response to these changes. Algo trading has also been suspected of increasing market volatility at times, even leading to so-called flash crashes.\n\n    - Regulation: Algorithmic trading is subject to various regulatory requirements and oversight, which can be complex and time-consuming to comply with.\n\n    - High Capital Costs: The development and implementation of algorithmic trading systems can be costly, and traders may need to pay ongoing fees for software and data feeds.\n\n    - Limited Customization: Algorithmic trading systems are based on pre-defined rules and instructions, which can limit the ability of traders to customize their trades to meet their specific needs or preferences.\n\n    - Lack of Human Judgment: Algorithmic trading relies on mathematical models and historical data, which means that it does not take into account the subjective and qualitative factors that can influence market movements. This lack of human judgment can be a disadvantage for traders who prefer a more intuitive or instinctive approach to trading.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Pros & Cons\n\n## Pros\n\n   - Instant order confirmation\n\n   - Potential for best price and lowest cost trades\n\n   - No human error in trade execution\n\n   - Not biased by human emotion\n\n## Cons\n\n   - Lack of human judgment in real-time\n\n   - Can lead to increased volatility or market instability at times\n\n   - High capital outlays to build and maintain software & hardware\n\n   - May be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Algo-Trading Time Scales\n\n- Algo-trading is used in many forms of trading and investment activities including:\n\n     - Mid- to long-term investors or buy-side firms—pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies—use algo-trading to purchase stocks in large quantities when they do not want to influence stock prices with discrete, large-volume investments.\n\n     - Short-term traders and sell-side participants—market makers (such as brokerage houses), speculators, and arbitrageurs—benefit from automated trade execution; in addition, algo-trading aids in creating sufficient liquidity for sellers in the market.\n\n     - Systematic traders—trend followers, hedge funds, or pairs traders (a market-neutral trading strategy that matches a long position with a short position in a pair of highly correlated instruments such as two stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or currencies)—find it much more efficient to program their trading rules and let the program trade automatically.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Momentum Investing\n\n- Momentum investing is a system of buying stocks or other securities that have had high returns over the past three to twelve months, and selling those that have had poor returns over the same period.\n\n- While momentum investing is well-established as a phenomenon no consensus exists about the explanation for this strategy, and economists have trouble reconciling momentum with the efficient market hypothesis and random walk hypothesis. Two main hypotheses have been submitted to explain the momentum effect in terms of an efficient market. In the first, it is assumed that momentum investors bear significant risk for assuming this strategy, and, therefore, the high returns are a compensation for the risk.Momentum strategies often involve disproportionately trading in stocks with high bid-ask spreads and so it is important to take transactions costs into account when evaluating momentum profitability.The second theory assumes that momentum investors are exploiting behavioral shortcomings in other investors, such as investor herding, investor over- and underreaction, disposition effects and confirmation bias.\n\n- Seasonal or calendar effects may help to explain some of the reason for success in the momentum investing strategy. If a stock has performed poorly for months leading up to the end of the year, investors may decide to sell their holdings for tax purposes causing for example the January effect. Increased supply of shares in the market drive its price down, causing others to sell. Once the reason for tax selling is eliminated, the stock's price tends to recover.\n\n### [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_investing)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Get Stock Price Data\n\n- Yahoo Finance is one of the most popular websites to collect stock price data.
