# Performance of momentum strategies

- In a study in 1993 Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman reported that this strategy give average returns of 1% per month for the following 3â€“12 months.[10] This finding has been confirmed by many other academic studies, some even going back to the 19th century,[11][12][13] though momentum strategies are associated with an increased risk of crashes and major losses.[5]

- Turnover tend to be high for momentum strategies, which could reduce the net returns of a momentum strategy. Some even claim that transaction costs wipe out momentum profits.[14] In their 2014 study 'fact, fiction, and momentum investing' Cliff Asness and his co-authors address 10 issues with regards to momentum investing, including transaction costs.[15]

- The performance of momentum comes with occasional large crashes. For example, in 2009, momentum experienced a crash of -73.42% in three months.[16] This downside risk of momentum can be reduced with a so called 'residual momentum' strategy in which only the stock specific part of momentum is used.[17]

- A momentum strategy can also be applied across industries and across markets
